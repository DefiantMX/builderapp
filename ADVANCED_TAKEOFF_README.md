- **15 - Mechanical**: HVAC, plumbing
- **16 - Electrical**: Power, lighting, communications
- And many more...

### Layer Management
Organize measurements by construction layers:
- **General**: Default layer for basic measurements
- **Foundation**: Below-grade work
- **Framing**: Structural elements
- **Electrical**: Power and lighting systems
- **Plumbing**: Water and waste systems
- **HVAC**: Heating, ventilation, air conditioning
- **Finishes**: Interior and exterior finishes
- **Site Work**: Landscaping and site improvements

## Export Options

### PDF Reports
Professional reports include:
- Project information and summary
- Division-based totals and breakdowns
- Detailed measurement listings
- Material and pricing information

## Best Practices

### Calibration
1. Always calibrate your drawing before measuring
2. Use known dimensions like door widths or room dimensions
3. Verify calibration with a second measurement
4. Update calibration if drawing scale changes

### Organization
1. Use appropriate CSI divisions for each measurement
2. Create custom layers for complex projects
3. Add descriptive labels to measurements
4. Include material types and pricing when possible

### Accuracy
1. Zoom in for precise measurements
2. Use the grid for alignment
3. Double-check measurements before finalizing
4. Document any assumptions or special conditions
